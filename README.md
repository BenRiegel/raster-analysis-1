# Simple Raster Analysis

This project demonstrates some simple raster analysis using python and the rasterio package. In a jupyter notebook, I walk through the steps of reading the raster data, making a plot, classifying the data, and saving the classified dataset to a new file.

The "data" folder for the project contains the main input dataset "elev_data.tif". This file contains elevation data for a small area along the coast of Maine. The python code is contained in the notebook "analysis.ipynb". The file "mask.tif" is the output dataset. The "environment.yml" file contains a list of all the python packages that the code requires to work.
